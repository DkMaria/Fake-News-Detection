# Fake-News-Detection

These experiments are part of my dissertation for MSc in Data Science program at International Hellenic University. The theme of the thesis is the fake news detection using knowledge graphs. The dataset which I used is the ClaimsKG dataset. 
There are 4 different approaches for fake news detection:
  1. TF-IDF & Multinomial Naive Bayes
  2. Word2Vec & LSTM
  3. BERT 
  4. TransE & XGBoost
