# Fake-News-Detection

This experiments are part of my dissertation for MSc in Data Science program. The theme of the thesis is the fake news detection using knowledge graphs. The dataset which I used is the ClaimsKG dataset. 
There are 4 different approaches for fake news detection:
  1. TF-IDF & Multinomial Naive Bayes
  2. Word2Vec & LSTM
  3. BERT 
  4. TransE & XGBoost
